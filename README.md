# Introduction
As a data analyst and active job seeker, I’ve spent countless hours navigating job boards, dissecting postings, and chasing clarity in a crowded market. What I found was noise, vague requirements, inflated titles, and skill lists that didn’t match the pay. So I built this project to cut through it.

# Background

This project was born out of frustration. As a data enthusiast actively seeking roles, I spent months navigating vague job descriptions, inflated titles, and skill lists that didn’t match the pay. I realized most job seekers face the same confusion and that clarity was missing from the market.

So I built this project to answer five critical questions about the data analytics job landscape:  
1. What are the top paying Data Analyst jobs?  
2. Which skills are required for these top paying jobs?  
3. Which skills are most in demand for Data Analysts?  
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?  
5. Which are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools Used

To dissect the data analytics job market with precision, I relied on a focused technical stack:

- **SQL** - My primary tool for querying and extracting insights from job posting data.
- **PostgreSQL** - A robust database engine suited for handling large, structured datasets.
- **Visual Studio Code** - Used for writing, debugging, and organizing SQL scripts efficiently.
- **Git & GitHub** - Enabled version control, collaboration, and transparent tracking of my analysis workflow.

# Analysis

This section breaks down the core questions driving this project—each answered through targeted SQL queries and data-backed insights. The goal wasn’t just to explore the job market, but to extract patterns that help job seekers make smarter, more strategic decisions.

## 1. 💰Top Paying Data Analyst Positions 2023
To identify the highest paying jobs, I filtered Data Analyst Positions by Salary and Location, focusing on Remote jobs. This Query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field,
``` sql
SELECT
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    round(salary_year_avg,0),
    name AS company_name
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim
    ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_work_from_home = TRUE 
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
    AND job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 5. 🎯 Optimal Skills to Learn

This query combines salary and demand data to identify the most strategic skills for aspiring Data Analysts. The goal: to find tools that are not only popular, but also pay well, offering the best return on learning investment.
``` sql
SELECT
    skills,
    round(avg(salary_year_avg),0) as avg_salary,
    count(skills_job_dim.job_id) as demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY skills
HAVING 
    (count(skills_job_dim.job_id) > 10)  
ORDER BY demand_count DESC
LIMIT 50;
```
💡 Key Insights:
- **SQL is non-negotiable**: With 398 mentions and a solid $97K average salary, SQL is the backbone of remote data analyst roles. Skip it and you're out of the game.
- **Python pays, but Snowflake and Go pay more**: Python is widely demanded (236 listings, $101K), but niche tools like Snowflake ($113K) and Go ($115K) offer sharper salary spikes with less competition.
- **Cloud and BI tools are the salary accelerators**: Azure ($111K), AWS ($108K), and Power BI ($97K) consistently appear in high-paying roles. Best option is to stack them with core analytics skills for maximum leverage.

# 📚 Learned Lessons
This project sharpened both my technical and strategic thinking. Here’s what I took away:
- **SQL isn’t just querying, it’s storytelling**. Crafting precise queries taught me how to extract meaning, not just data.
- **Data without context is noise**. Salary and demand only matter when tied to real-world decisions.
- **Visualization is leverage**. Charts and tables helped me communicate insights that raw numbers couldn’t.
- **The job market is a dataset**. With the right tools, even career confusion becomes a solvable problem.
